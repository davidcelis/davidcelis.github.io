I want to pair with all sorts of people. If you're a junior developer and/or you are just getting into programming, it's a good chance for me to improve my teaching abilities. If you're a more senior developer, you can teach me some technical things and hopefully some things about pairing itself! Let's have some fun and teach each other how to be better programmers! Here are some things to keep in mind:

* Most importantly: we're both offering up our time for free, so let's work on something that's free. This is my one requirement! It doesn't matter if it's your project, or mine, or some library for which you want to write a patch. As long as it's free, let's do it!
* I consider myself to be an intermediate (maybe close to advanced) Ruby/Rails developer. If you end up thinking I'm better, let me know! If you think I'm worse, don't! :sob:
* I don't strictly subscribe to TDD, but I've found it to be a good pairing style/technique.
* I mostly use Sublime Text, but I can sorta handle myself in Vim. If you're a Vim pro, most of our pairing session will probably be comprised of me asking, "What? How'd you do that? :hushed:"
* I'm using resources found at the great [Pair Program With Me][pair-program-with-me] site.
* I'm in Portland, OR but I'm open to pairing remotely. Portland is in PST or PDT depending on the time of year.
* I tend to be available on evenings during the weekdays, and throughout the day on weekends. Keep this and the above in mind when trying to work out a schedule with me!
