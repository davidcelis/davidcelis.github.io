Programming is awesome, but do you know what's even more awesome? **Programming with a friend**. So...

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">{coded="PZ@KkywKxZ2.wX";key="nNzYf5wjkO1QIsW8lRD7c3HT0mLXvo2C9rxgVeBPphybqSd4UJMZA6iFatEuKG";shift=coded.length;link="";for(i=0;i<coded.length;i++){if(key.indexOf(coded.charAt(i))==-1){ltr=coded.charAt(i);link+=ltr}else{ltr=(key.indexOf(coded.charAt(i))-shift+key.length)%key.length;link+=key.charAt(ltr)}}document.write('<div class="center"><a href="mailto:'+link+'?subject=Pair%20with%20me!"><img src="/images/pairing.svg" alt="Pair program with me!"></a></div>')}</script>

I want to pair with all sorts of people, but bonus points if you're a junior developer and/or you are just getting into programming. I have experience being a mentor and would love to improve as a teacher. Let's pair, and I can help you learn Ruby and Rails! Otherwise, there's always so much to learn, and pair programming is such a great way to do it. Let's have some fun and teach each other how to be better programmers! Here are some things to keep in mind:

* Most importantly: we're both offering up our time for free, so let's work on something that's free. This is my one requirement! It doesn't matter if it's your project, or mine, or some library for which you want to write a patch. As long as it's free, let's do it!
* My priority is pairing with juniors to help them learn, but I really do want to pair with anybody who's willing!
* I consider myself to be an intermediate (maybe close to advanced) Ruby/Rails developer. If you end up thinking I'm better, let me know! If you think I'm worse, don't! :sob:
* I don't strictly subscribe to TDD, but I've found it to be a good pairing style/technique.
* I mostly use Sublime Text, but I can handle myself in Vim. If you're a Vim pro, most of our pairing session will probably be comprised of me asking, "What? How'd you do that? :hushed:"
* I'm using resources found at the great [Pair Program With Me][pair-program-with-me] site.
* I'm in Portland, OR but I'm open to pairing remotely.
* You click the button now!
