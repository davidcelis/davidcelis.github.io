  <p>
    I’m an empathy-driven backend engineer specializing in designing elegant APIs
    with a keen eye toward usability and maintainability. I strive for a user-first
    approach, understanding that users come from a variety of backgrounds that differ
    from my own, while also producing readable, well-tested, and well-measured code.
    Outside of work, I’m an avid Open Source Software advocate. I maintain
    <a href="#projects">several open source libraries</a> and have contributed
    to many more, including
    <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>,
    <a href="http://bundler.io/">bundler</a>,
    <a href="http://discourse.org/">Discourse</a>,
    <a href="http://hanamirb.org">Hanami</a>, and
    <a href="http://fishshell.com/">fish</a>.

  <a class="job" href="https://firehydrant.com/">FireHydrant</a>
  <span class="date">July 2021 - Now</span>
  <span class="title">Staff Software Engineer</span>

  <p class="clear">
    I'm the lead engineer of FireHydrant's Incident Management team, which
    is responsible for incidents and all parts of their lifecycle: declaration,
    automation, resolution, retrospectives, and our Slack application that
    enables robust incident response from the comfort of a powerful chatops tool.
    As team lead, I work closely with our manager and head of product to guide
    the team's roadmap, architecture, and process/health.

  <a class="job" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>
  <span class="date">November 2019 - May 2021</span>
  <span class="title">Staff Software Engineer</span>

  <p class="clear">
    I began at Stripe on the API Platform team, responsible for the
    framework used by product engineering teams to create and maintain
    the API that has firmly planted Stripe as a developer-first company.
    On this team, I led a company-wide audit of Stripe’s heavily-used
    feature flagging system, determining the purpose, ownership, and
    intended lifecycle of every single feature flag that had been created.
    This audit had immense and lasting impact on how Stripe engineers
    approached their use of feature flags, drastically reducing the number
    of flags being created for private, one-off features. After my time
    on API Platform, I moved to work on Stripe’s
    <a href="https://stripe.com/issuing">Issuing</a> product. There, I
    acted as engineering lead for the launch of a brand new Commercial
    Payout Card product, a five month project spanning almost ten
    separate workstreams and over a dozen other engineers.

  <a class="job" href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">HashiCorp</a>
  <span class="date">November 2017 - November 2019</span>
  <span class="title">Senior Software Engineer</span>

  <p class="clear">
    At HashiCorp, I worked on Terraform Cloud (TFC). Terraform is a
    free and open-source utility that allows engineers and teams to
    automate the process of provisioning infrastructure by defining
    that infrastructure as code. Terraform Cloud is essentially to
    Terraform as GitHub is to Git, adding remote state storage and
    collaborative features to Terraform. When I joined HashiCorp,
    I was on the team responsible for TFC’s JSON API, its
    integration with Sentinel (an embeddable policy-as-code
    framework) and, occasionally, tinkering with its Ember frontend
    or surrounding Go microservices. At HashiCorp, I lead several
    large projects, including preparing version 2 of the API for
    exiting its beta status, a new administration API for Terraform
    Enterprise,
    <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-policy-sets-in-terraform-enterprise">
      Sentinel Policy Sets
    </a>, and

  <a class="job" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a><span class="staff-badge resume">Staff</span>
  <span class="date">January 2016 - October 2017</span>
  <span class="title">Ecosystem Engineer</span>

  <p class="clear">
    As a member of GitHub’s Ecosystem Engineering organization, I shared responsibility
    for building and maintaining GitHub’s developer APIs, third-party integrations,
    webhooks, and developer documentation. I was a member of the team that shipped
    the pre-release of GitHub’s GraphQL API, after which I spent my time on the
    Identity Access Management (IAM) team shipping Business accounts and GitHub
    Apps. I also onboarded myself onto GitHub’s main on-call rotation after only
    three months on the job. At my final performance review, I was told that my
    on-call logs were consistently amongst the best at the company.
  </p>

  <a class="job" href="https://immun.io/">IMMUNIO</a>
  <span class="date">April 2015 - December 2015</span>
  <span class="title">Software Engineer</span>

  <p class="clear">
    At IMMUNIO, I designed the Ruby API that powered their front-end Angular
    dashboard. I also helped implement features to aggregate data on customers’
    most important security vulnerabilities. Prior to this project, suspicious
    events would be displayed in long, paginated lists. I worked closely with the
    front-end developer to roll up suspicious events into clear, ongoing attacks
    so customers could easily find them and fix them in their application’s code
    base.
  </p>

  <a class="job" href="http://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>
  <span class="date">August 2014 - March 2015</span>
  <span class="title">Software Engineer</span>

  <p class="clear">
    I helped improve response times by hundreds of milliseconds in some of the
    least performant Cloud dashboard pages and developer API endpoints. I also
    worked on an effort to re-implement and re-design DigitalOcean’s DNS product.
    DigitalOcean’s backend was previously a series of Perl scripts running in a
    loop. As part of a larger effort to re- architect their backend as a network
    of Go microservices, I aided the rewrite of DNS so I could gain experience in
    Go. Finally, I was part of a team focused on improving the usability and
    functionality of various internal tools, including a custom CMS used heavily
    by their Customer Support team.
  </p>

  <a class="job" href="http://www.newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>
  <span class="date">October 2012 - August 2014</span>
  <span class="title">Senior Software Engineer</span>

  <p class="clear">
    I worked on the customer-facing dashboard for their flagship product, the APM
    dashboard, which received billions of metrics from millions of applications
    each day. My team developed popular features such as Key Transactions and X-Ray
    sessions. After acting as the PM on a minor feature, I joined an internal effort
    to lay the foundations for New Relic to migrate to a service-oriented
    architecture, developing several identity services.
  </p>

  <a class="job" href="http://www.deckmonitoring.com/">DECK Monitoring</a>
  <span class="date">May 2011 - July 2012</span>
  <span class="title">Software Engineer</span>

  <p class="clear">
    I worked on a dashboard to display solar energy usage and generation metrics
    to thousands of residential and business customers who would report 100-200
    pieces of data each minute. My major contribution to DECK Monitoring was the
    automation of reporting this data to California utility companies on behalf
    of customers seeking tax benefits.

  <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

  <a class="project" href="https://sparkles.lol">Sparkles</a>
  <span class="date">October 2021 - Now</span>

  <p class="clear">
    Sparkles is an <a href="https://github.com/davidcelis/sparkles">open source</a>
    Slack application that replicates a silly points bot that I missed from my days
    at GitHub. It simply provides a command (<code>/sparkle</code>) that lets
    you recognize a teammate or coworker for helping you, saying something funny,
    or any reason at all, in the form of a meaningless sparkle point. I added
    my own flavor by creating a web frontend to keep metriculous track of each
    detail about each Sparkle, even providing a link back to the Slack message
    that originally created it for context.
  </p>

  <a class="project" href="https://acnh.apps.davidcel.is/">Nook Stop API</a>
  <span class="date">October 2021 - Now</span>

  <p class="clear">
    In June 2022, I delivered a tech talk to coworkers at FireHydrant about GraphQL,
    a technology I'm passionate about and wanted to introduce internally. In order
    to provide an in-depth demonstration on everything I love about GraphQL, I wrote
    a way-too-comprehensive API using data from <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>.
    The code is, of course, <a href="https://github.com/davidcelis/nook_stop_api">open source</a>,
    and the demo site remains live for anybody who is interested in GraphQL and who
    wants to play around with some queries.
  </p>

  <a class="project" href="https://github.com/davidcelis/goodbre.ws">goodbre.ws</a>
  <span class="date">January 2011 - March 2014</span>

  <p class="clear">
    goodbre.ws was a project borne out of my last year in the Rollins College
    Computer Science department. As a senior in the honors program, I was expected
    to produce, present, and defend an exceptional capstone project for and to the
    faculty. I chose to build my own collaborative filtering system based on the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccardian Similarity Coefficient</a>.
    To provide a practical application for this system, I created goodbre.ws, a
    recommendation website for beer written in Ruby on Rails. The site was
    unexpectedly featured on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5947790/goodbrews-tracks-the-beer-you-like-suggests-brews-youd-love">Lifehacker</a>
    and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/goodbrews-beer-recommendations-exploration-website_n_1930567.html">The Huffington Post</a>.
  </p>

  <a class="project" href="https://github.com/davidcelis/recommendable">Recommendable</a>
  <span class="date">2012 - 2018</span>

  <p class="clear">
    Recommendable is a Ruby library that I extracted from goodbre.ws. It is a
    drop-in recommender system for Ruby applications using Likes and Dislikes.
    Ratings and recommendations are stored in Redis to utilize fast set mathematics
    for collaborative filtering.

  <a class="project" href="https://github.com/davidcelis/rack-console">rack-console</a>
  <span class="date">2014 - 2018</span>

  <p class="clear">
    rack-console is a Ruby gem to provide an interactive Ruby interpreter for any
    Rack-based web application. Think of it like <code>rails console</code> for
    everything but Rails.
  </p>

  <a class="project" href="https://github.com/crepe">Crepe</a>
  <span class="date">2013 - 2017</span>

  <p class="clear">
    Crepe is a lightweight API framework designed to help you write clean, fast
    web services in Ruby. I joined as a maintainer in 2013 and provided pieces
    to Crepe’s surrounding ecosystem such as Creperie (a project generator and
    CLI) and a plugin to report performance metrics to New Relic.
  </p>

  <a class="project" href="https://davidcel.is/projects/sunscreen">Sunscreen</a>
  <span class="date">2014 - 2016</span>

  <p class="clear">
    Sunscreen is a macOS app that I wrote for fun. A lightweight menu bar app
    that changes your desktop wallpaper based on local sunrise and sunset times,
    Sunscreen was my first (but hopefully not last) foray into Swift and Xcode.

  <a class="school" href="http://www.rollins.edu/">Rollins College</a>
  <span class="date">2007 - 2011</span>
  <span class="title">Computer Science, B.A.H.</span>

  <p class="clear">
    I graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> with a B.A.H in Computer Science. I
    graduated in the top 5 of my class with a 3.99 GPA (4.0 Major GPA) and was
    on the President’s List for all terms.
