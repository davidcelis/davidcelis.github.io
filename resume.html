<p>
  I'm a full-stack web developer who specializes in architecting elegant APIs
  with an eye towards usability and maintainability. I am passionate about
  beautiful, readable code and believe strongly in community-driven coding
  standards. When I am not writing products that directly benefit other
  engineers, I'm an avid <a href="/projects/">Open Source Software</a> advocate.

<p class="clear">
  As a Ruby Agent Engineer, I am responsible for the Ruby gem that reports
  customer data back to IMMUNIO's top-notch security monitoring service while
  remaining performant and crash-free. I also architected the API that powers
  IMMUNIO's front-end dashboard and have implemented features to aggregate data
  on customers' most important security vulnerabilities so they can easily find
  them and fix them in their code bases.

  I helped improve response times in some of the least performant Cloud
