<p>
  I'm a full-stack web developer who specializes in architecting elegant APIs
  with an eye towards usability and maintainability. I am passionate about
  beautiful, readable code and believe strongly in community-driven coding
  standards. When I am not writing products that directly benefit other
  engineers, I'm an avid <a href="/projects/">Open Source Software</a> advocate.
  I maintain many open source libraries (some of which are listed below) and
  have contributed to many more, including
  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>,
  <a href="http://bundler.io/">bundler</a>,
  <a href="http://discourse.org/">Discourse</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/lotus">Lotus</a>, and
  <a href="http://fishshell.com/">fish</a>.

<h2>Experience</h2>

<a class="job" href="https://immun.io/">IMMUNIO</a>
<span class="date">April 2015 - Today</span>
<span class="title">Ruby Agent Engineer</span>

<p class="clear">
  As a Ruby Agent Engineer, I am responsible for the Ruby gem that reports
  customer data back to IMMUNIO's top-notch security monitoring service while
  remaining performant and crash-free. I also architected the API that powers
  IMMUNIO's front-end dashboard and have implemented features to aggregate data
  on customers' most important security vulnerabilities so they can easily find
  them and fix them in their code bases.
</p>

<a class="job" href="http://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>
<span class="date">August 2014 - March 2015</span>
<span class="title">Software Engineer</span>

<p class="clear">
  I helped improve response times in some of the least performant Cloud
  dashboard pages and developer API endpoints. I also worked on an effort to
  re-implement and re-design DigitalOcean's DNS product. Finally, I was part of
  a team focused on improving the usability and functionality of various
  internal tools, including a custom CMS used heavily by their Customer Support
  team.
</p>

<a class="job" href="http://www.newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>
<span class="date">October 2012 - August 2014</span>
<span class="title">Senior Software Engineer</span>

<p class="clear">
  I worked on the customer-facing dashboard for their APM product, helping
  develop features such as Key Transactions and X-Ray sessions. After leading
  the development of a new feature as project manager, I joined an internal
  effort to lay down the foundations for New Relic to migrate to a
  service-oriented architecture.
</p>

<a class="job" href="http://www.deckmonitoring.com/">DECK Monitoring</a>
<span class="date">May 2011 - July 2012</span>
<span class="title">Software Engineer</span>

<p class="clear">
  I worked on a dashboard to display solar energy usage and generation metrics
  to customers. My major contribution to DECK Monitoring was the automation of
  reporting solar data to California utility companies on behalf of DECK
  customers seeking tax benefits.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<a class="project" href="https://github.com/davidcelis/goodbre.ws">goodbre.ws</a>
<span class="date">January 2011 - March 2014</span>

<p class="clear">
  goodbre.ws was a project borne out of my last year in the Rollins College
  Computer Sciencede partment. As a senior in the honors program, I was expected
  to produce an exceptional capstone project, present it, and defend it to the
  faculty. I chose to build my own collaborative filtering system based on the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccardian Similarity Coefficient</a>.
  To provide a practical application for this system, I created goodbre.ws, a
  recommendation website for beer written in Ruby on Rails. The site was
  unexpectedly featured on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5947790/goodbrews-tracks-the-beer-you-like-suggests-brews-youd-love">Lifehacker</a>
  and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/goodbrews-beer-recommendations-exploration-website_n_1930567.html">The Huffington Post</a>.
</p>

<a class="project" href="https://github.com/davidcelis/recommendable">Recommendable</a>
<span class="date">January 2012 - Today</span>

<p class="clear">
  Recommendable is a gem that I extracted from goodbre.ws. It is a drop-in
  recommender system for Ruby applications using Likes and Dislikes. Ratings
  and recommendations are stored in Redis to utilize fast set math for
  collaborative filtering.
</p>

<a class="project" href="https://github.com/crepe">Crepe</a>
<span class="date">September 2013 - Today</span>

<p class="clear">
  Crepe is a lightweight API framework designed to help you write clean, fast
  web services in Ruby. With an elegant and intuitive DSL inspired by RSpec, and
  with a nod to Grape, Crepe makes API design simple. Originally written by my
  brother and a friend of his, I joined as a maintainer in 2013 as I began to
  provide pieces to Crepe's ecosystem such as Creperie (a project generator and
  CLI) and a plugin to report data to New Relic.
</p>

<a class="project" href="https://github.com/davidcelis/rack-console">rack-console</a>
<span class="date">July 2014 - Today</span>

<p class="clear">
  rack-console is a Ruby gem to provide an interactive Ruby interpreter for any
  Rack-based web application. Think of it like <code>rails console</code> for
  everything but Rails.
