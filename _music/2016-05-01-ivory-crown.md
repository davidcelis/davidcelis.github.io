If you liked "Only Phone Number", we finally released the EP that I joined The Jackalope Saints to help record in the first place. It includes "Only Phone Number" and five other Americana/Folk songs. This album was almost two years in the making. It should have been done much sooner, but communication between us, the recording studio, and our mixers took quite a long time. But it's finally out! And here it is.
