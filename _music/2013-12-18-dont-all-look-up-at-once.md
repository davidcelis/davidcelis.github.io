The last post on Ezra Bell I showed you was just a taste of what was in store. Pretty quickly, we were able to record our first EP. It's called "Don't All Look Up At Once", and I'll let the music speak for itself. Check it out below and maybe [get it on Band Camp](http://ezrabell.bandcamp.com/album/dont-all-look-up-at-once).
