I finally got to record another music video, this time with the new group. We ended up going to this semi-abandoned barn outside of McMinnville, OR and shooting this footage. The hope was to catch a majestic shot of the large, white barn own living in the raftors. Unfortunately, by the time we made it to the barn and the camera person had poked his head upstairs, the barn owl was already gone.

We think the video is pretty decent anyway.
