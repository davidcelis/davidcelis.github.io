Hi! My name is David Celis. I'm a software engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com) (where I write [APIs](https://developer.github.com/v3/)) out in Portland, Ore. (where I drink [IPAs](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23066/60750/)). In the past, I have worked for other top-tier companies such as [New Relic](http://www.newrelic.com) and [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com).

I also write [open-source software](/projects/) as much as possible; I believe strongly in the world of free software and the amazing community it fosters. I have written and maintained several popular libaries and contributed to dozens more.

My main hobby is [music](/music/). I've been a classical pianist for a while, but in the past few years I've turned to folk music. On my own, I mostly do covers, but I've also played in several groups. I'm currently a member of [The Jackalope Saints](http://www.jackalopesaints.com), where I play trumpet, keyboard, and even sometimes the glockenspiel.

Looking for a great web developer to do some freelance work for you? Check out my [résumé](/resume/) and [get in touch](mailto:me@davidcel.is).
