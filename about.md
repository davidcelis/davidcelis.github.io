Hi! My name is David Celis. I'm a Ruby Agent engineer currently working for [immun.io](http://immun.io/) (where I also enjoy writing APIs) out in Portland, Ore. (where I also enjoy drinking IPAs). In the past, I have worked for top-tier companies such as [New Relic](http://www.newrelic.com/) and [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com/).

I also write [open-source software](/projects/) as much as possible; I believe strongly in the world of free software and the amazing community it fosters. I have written and maintained several popular libaries and contributed to dozens more.

My main hobby is [music](/music/). I've been a classical pianist for a while, but in the past few years I've turned to folk music. On my own, I mostly do covers, but I've also played in several groups. I'm currently a member of [The Jackalope Saints](http://www.jackalopesaints.com), where I play trumpet, keyboard, and even sometimes the glockenspiel.

_P.S: [pair with me](/pair-with-me/)!_
