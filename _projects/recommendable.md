[Recommendable][recommendable] is a gem that allows you to quickly add a recommendation engine for Likes and Dislikes to your Ruby application using my version of [Jaccardian similarity and memory-based collaborative filtering][collaborative filtering]. It was originally extracted from [goodbre.ws][goodbrews].
