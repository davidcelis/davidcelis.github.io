Sunscreen is a lightweight application that changes your desktop wallpaper based on sunrise and sunset. Simply drag and drop your favorite wallpapers into Sunscreen's preferences, and it'll do the rest!

Sunscreen supports giving five different periods of the day their own wallpaper:

* Sunrise
* Morning
* Afternoon
* Sunset
* Night

If you want to skip a period and leave the wallpaper alone, you can simply leave one of those periods empty. For example, if you leave Afternoon empty, the wallpaper for Morning will also be used for Afternoon.

If you've encountered a bug with Sunscreen or have any questions or comments, please feel free to [email me](mailto:me@davidcel.is) or [open a bug report](https://github.com/davidcelis/Sunscree/issues/new).
