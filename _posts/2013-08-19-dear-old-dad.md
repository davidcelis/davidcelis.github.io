  I was in Portland filming a video for a client with my team, Steven and Jen. We were out capturing shots of the city at night by the river. From across a giant field, I heard what I thought was a drum circle. When I ran over to check it out, I discovered it was an entire band that was busking in the park. And their music was beautiful. It instantly touched my soul the way only great music can. I knew I had to capture it. So I called Steven and Jen and told them to drop everything and meet me at the park with all our equipment, which we just happened to have with us at the time. We set up the four cameras we had on our jib and steadycam and tripod and captured this performance, as well as two other songs. Which are coming soon. I got home and edited this video before I even unpacked.

  Spontaneous. Inspired. Soulful. Everything I love about music is captured right here.
