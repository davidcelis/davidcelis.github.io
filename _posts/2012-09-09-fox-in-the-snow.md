Well, friends, this is where it all began. This was my first foray into singing while playing the piano, and it's still one of my favorite songs to play. Everything I've done on the piano for the past few years has stemmed from this one song and, in a way, has led to this song.

This song is "The Fox in the Snow", off of Belle and Sebastian's album _If You're Feeling Sinister_. It was their second album, released back in 1996. So it's an "old" one, but a great one. Hope you guys enjoy it.
