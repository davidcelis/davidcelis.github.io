Sometimes it’s hard to estimate how much time you need to complete a project. Developers often underestimate how much time we need to deliver a new feature, especially with changes and iterations involved. It can be demoralizing to get it wrong, and we often do. As the lead on a recent project, I learned the hard way after a steady stream of bad estimates, changing requirements and scope creep caused a one-month project to be delayed – repeatedly – until it had been five months.
