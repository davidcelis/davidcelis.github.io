  Hi! I’m David Celis. I’m a software engineer at <a href="https://firehydrant.com">FireHydrant</a> (where I write
  <a href="https://developers.firehydrant.io/docs/api/45e95416400d6-fire-hydrant-api">APIs</a>) out in Portland, Ore.
  (where I drink <a href="https://breakside.com/our_beer/breakside-ipa/">IPAs</a>).
  In the past, I have worked for other top-tier companies such as
  <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a><span class="staff-badge">Staff</span>,
  <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">HashiCorp</a>,
  <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>, and
  <a href="http://www.newrelic.com">New Relic</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I also write <a href="/projects/">open-source software</a> as much as possible; I believe
  strongly in the world of free software and the amazing community it fosters. I have written
  and maintained several popular libraries and contributed to dozens more.
</p>

<p>
  My main hobby is <a href="/music/">music</a>. I’ve been a classical pianist for a while, but
  in the past few years I’ve turned to folk music. On my own, I mostly do covers, but I’ve also
  played in several groups. Most recently, I was a member of the now-disbanded
  <a href="http://www.jackalopesaints.com">Jackalope Saints</a>, where I played trumpet,
  keyboard and, occasionally, the glockenspiel.
