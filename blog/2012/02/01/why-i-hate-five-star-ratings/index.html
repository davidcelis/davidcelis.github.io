	<h2 class="title">Why I Hate Five-Star Ratings</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>A question I get often when discussing <a href="http://goodbre.ws/">goodbre.ws</a> and, more recently,
<a href="http://github.com/davidcelis/recommendable">recommendable</a>, is why I chose to implement a system based on Likes and
Dislikes rather than the more standard five-star rating scale. Usually, I&#8217;m
short and succinct: I think that star rating systems suck. Sometimes, I do go
into a bit more detail: I think that star rating systems really suck. However,
I&#8217;m starting to think that people may be asking this question and expecting some
sort of &#8220;actual answer&#8221;, so today I would like to go into just why I think that
the five-star rating scale is terrible, and why I decided to use the binary
system of likes and dislikes.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The ★★★★★ scale</h2>

<p>The star rating scale is arguably the most classic of all, so it&#8217;s not
surprising that a lot of websites use it. Big e-commerce sites like Amazon and
eBay utilize the five-star scale, and Netflix also uses a five-star scale to
power its review system and recommendations. There are, of course, variations.
IMDB uses a ten-star scale, which may as well be a 5-star scale that allows half
stars (such as reviews on BeerAdvocate). There are a lot of ways to handle the
star-scale, but what I&#8217;d like to get at is that they all suck.</p>

<h3>Ambiguity and uncertainty of the scale</h3>

<p>One of my big gripes about the five-star scale is ambiguity behind the ratings
that you are allowed to give. What exactly distinguishes between three stars and
four stars? What is enough to push your rating up to that next star? What is
enough to pull it down? Because of a lack of clarity, star ratings can end up
being very subjective. It is easy to end up with two people who give an item the
same three-star rating but actually feel differently about it. Some websites
attempt to handle this reasonably. Netflix, for instance, used to present some
explanatory text for each star when hovering over them during a rating:</p>

<p>★ (Hated it)<br/>
★★ (Didn&#8217;t like it)<br/>
★★★ (Liked it)<br/>
★★★★ (Really liked it)<br/>
★★★★★ (Loved it)</p>

<p>At the time of writing this post, Netflix no longer displays this text when
submitting a rating. Instead, posting a rating to Netflix now closely resembles
the act of doing so on Amazon: you are simply presented with five clickable
stars and left alone with your fears and preconceptions. This is how it often is
when submitting a star rating.</p>

<p>However, even the explanatory text itself can end up coming off as subjective.
What does it mean to &#8220;really&#8221; like a movie? Why are the intervals between the
options unequal (i.e. no &#8220;Really disliked it&#8221; option)? The explanatory text can
help if done correctly, but it can also simply add to the subjectivity of
submitted ratings.</p>

<h3>Unreliability of ratings</h3>

<p>Because a star rating scale iteslf is so ambiguous and uncertain, so too are the
ratings submitted to it. Many users will not use this scale as intended even
with intent given in the form of explanatory text. Many users <em>will</em> use the
scale as intended, but that usage is always based on their subjective ability to
understand the way the scale should be used.</p>

<p>Despite this, recommendation systems will accept these ratings as statistically
accurate communications. Websites with huge samples of users and ratings may not
seem to be negatively affected by the unreliable nature of these ratings. It is
likely that that this unreliability becomes normalized as the data sample grows.
Smaller websites and recommendation systems experiencing the &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start">cold start</a>&#8221;,
however, will suffer due to the subjective nature of its small rating sample.</p>

<h3>Binary voting is already happening</h3>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Seems like when it comes to ratings it&#8217;s pretty much all or nothing. Great videos prompt action; anything less prompts indifference.'>
Despite being a scale with five possible ratings, people tend to
vote in a binary fashion anyway. Back in 2009, YouTube <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2009/09/five-stars-dominate-ratings.html">published some
interesting data</a> concerning the ratings that videos had been receiving. As
it turns out, a huge majority of videos would receive mostly five-star ratings.
I think that YouTube&#8217;s takeaway from this data was spot on. &#34;Seems like when it comes to ratings it&#8217;s pretty much all or nothing. Great videos prompt action; anything less prompts indifference.&#34; The second highest rating was,
of course, one star. This is a great example of binary voting in the works. A
lot of people give mostly five-star ratings for things they like. If they
don&#8217;t like that thing, they either give it one star or simply bounce and skip
rating it entirely. I&#8217;ve also spoken to friends and acquaintances who admit to
giving almost exclusively four-star ratings to things they like, and three-
star ratings to things that are &#8220;just ok&#8221;.
</span></p>

<p>YouTube toyed with the idea of switching their rating system to a &#8220;favorites&#8221;
system to &#8220;declare your love for a video&#8221;, but ultimately settled on the thumbs
up or down options we know and love today. There was some level of outcry from
YouTube users expressing dismay at the change in rating scale, but there&#8217;s been
no evidence to support this group as anything more than a loud minority.</p>

<h2>The binary scale (and why it&#8217;s better)</h2>

<p>Binary rating scales are another popular system. As mentioned earlier, YouTube
now operates on a thumbs up or down rating scale. Other websites that utilize a
similar scale include reddit (upvotes and downvotes) and digg (digging or
burying). Some social networking sites take this even a step further and remove
the negative rating option entirely (e.g. Facebook only has likes and Google+
has only has the +1 button). I&#8217;d like to focus on the classic Like/Dislike pair.
What makes this system better than a five-star system?</p>

<h3>Less ambiguous</h3>

<p>The binary rating scale removes a large amount of ambiguity present in the star
rating systems. Five (or more) subjective rating options are aggregated down
into two options based on words that are easily understandable by native
speakers of the language. It is much easier for a person to declare, &#8220;Hey, I
like this thing&#8221; than it is to determine, &#8220;Well, I like this thing&#8230; But do I
&#8216;three stars&#8217; like it, or do I &#8216;four stars&#8217; like it?&#8221;</p>

<h3>Less subjective</h3>

<p>A large amount of subjectivity is also removed. Ratings given that are based
directly on feelings are much more likely to match than ratings given based on
numbers. This can simplify a lot of situations in which two people may have
similar feelings about something but rated it different:</p>

<ul>
<li>Me: &#8220;I liked this thing and rated it four stars.&#8221;<br/>
Friend: &#8220;I liked this thing and rated it five stars.&#8221;</li>
<li>Me: &#8220;I liked this thing and rated it three stars.&#8221;<br/>
Friend: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t like this thing, so I only gave it three stars.&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>Our feelings about something are clearly not conveyed well by star ratings, and
they don&#8217;t match. As I posited earlier, this can normalize given a large set of
data, but this does not change that we have no way of knowing whether or not the
underlying ratings are truly indicative of agreement. Given a binary scale,
however, agreement is much more clear: &#8220;We both liked this thing&#8221; or &#8220;we both
disliked this thing.&#8221;</p>

<h3>People are already doing this!</h3>

<p>Third, as stated earlier, <em>people are pretty much already rating in this way</em>.
Why fight it?</p>

<h3>No middle ground</h3>

<p>Of course, the Like/Dislike system is not without its own flaws. Most notably,
unless implemented, there isn&#8217;t an explicit neutral ground in a binary rating
system aside from abstaining from a vote. It&#8217;s an all-or-nothing situation in
which you either like something or you don&#8217;t. This may or may not be an issue
for you as the implementor. Personally, when I&#8217;m ready to rate an item, I can
always manage to categorize it into a like or dislike even if its very close.
However, if I were to truly feel 100% neutral about something, I would likely
ignore that thing and move on rather than rate it. If I have no feelings either
way, why would I want it affecting my recommendations?</p>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>Embrace the binary rating system. It&#8217;s much less ambiguous and subjective than
its stellar cousin, and it&#8217;s much easier for the user to deal with in general.
Feelings themselves are more easily comparable than numbers indirectly based on
feelings and can lead to more accurate recommendations.</p>
